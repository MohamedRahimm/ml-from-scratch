# Multi-classification Neural Network from Scratch

This repository contains Python files implementing a multi-classification neural
network from scratch.

_Note: The model implementation is from scratch while metric and graph analysis
depend on external librares_

## Files Included

1. Jupyter Notebook:
   - This notebook provides a step-by-step process of building the neural
     network from scratch.
2. Python File (Final Model):
   - This file contains the final implementation of the neural network model.
     It's a standalone Python script that you can use for prediction or further
     development.
3. PKL File (Pretrained Model): -The pkl file included in this repository
   contains the pretrained model. You can directly load this model instead of
   going through the training process.

## Usage

1. Pretrained Model:
   - Load the pretrained model by using the commented code in the Python file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, pickle, pandas, sklearn, seaborn
